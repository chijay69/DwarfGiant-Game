create a dictionary and use the names, age, key as keys.

# dictionary to store unique pairs
unique_employees = {}

# loop through and add to dictionary this ensures zero duplicates by overriding data that has been added with newer data
for employee in employees:
    key = (employee["department"], employee["name"], employee["age"])
    unique_employees[key] = employee

# make a list of unique employees
unique_employee_list = list(unique_employees.values())

# print(unique_employee_list)
# print(unique_employees)

# get the length of unique values
total_employees = len(unique_employee_list)

# create an empty pair to store pair values
employee_pairs = []

# loop through unique values to create a pair
 for i in range(total_employees):
     dwarf = unique_employee_list[i]["name"]
     giant_index = (i + 1) % total_employees  # Circular indexing for pairs
     giant = unique_employee_list[giant_index]["name"]
     employee_pairs.append((dwarf, giant))
